            <header>LEARN PYTHON IN FEW MINUTES</header>
            <p>Python is a beautiful language just like all normal human languages. It has a very simple syntax. You must be
                wondering what syntax is? It is just a fancy name for the codes we write. The cool thing about python is
                that it is one of the most used in the world, even by big companies like google. In short, it is simple and
                very powerful!</p>
            <p> A typical python code looks as simple as below:</p>
            <pre>
                    <code>
                        if 1 &lt; 2: 
                            print("1 is less than 2") 
                        else: 
                            print("1 is not greater than 2")
                    </code>
                </pre>
            <p>You see? It is as simple as what you know. It gets more detailed but not too complicated.</p>
            <p>Thigns you can do in python include:</p>

            <li>Data science: Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>Web development</li>
            <li>Automation of tasks</li>
            <li>Software Development</li>
            <p></p>
        </section>

        <section id="Python_as_a_Calculator" class="main-section">
            <header>Python as a Calculator</header>
            <p>Python is also a calculator and can be used to do simple and extremely complex calculations. This is very useful
                to do our complex task to building the biggest intelligent machines in the world. It can also help in building
                games too.
            </p>
            <p>Arithmetic Operations include:</p>
            <li>Addition(+)</li>
            <li>Subtraction(-)</li>
            <li>Division(/)</li>
            <li>Multiplication(*)</li>
            <li>Modulo or Remainder(%)</li>
        </section>

        <section id="Numbers" class="main-section">
            <header>Numbers</header>
            <p> The python interpreter is just like the calculators we use. You can give it some instructions, and it gives the
                result. It also follows similar operations we use in our normal life.</p>
            <p> In python, we have:</p>
            <li>int(integer)</li>
            <li>float</li>

            <p>Integers are basically whole numbers while float are fractions. You can perform all the above and more mathematical
                operations on these number types. '#' sign is used for commenting.
            </p>

            <p>example of addition operations:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    #integer 
                    2 + 3 = 5 
                    
                    #float 
                    4.4 + 2.5 = 6.9
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Subtraction:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    #integer 
                    5-3 = 2 
                    
                    #float 
                    8.6 - 3.4 = 5.2 
                    
                    #float and integer 
                    6.5 - 4 = 2.5
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Division:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    #integer division 
                    20 / 5 = 4 

                    #float and integer division 
                    5.5/5 = 1.1
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Multiplication:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    20 * 5 = 100
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Square root: In python. 3
                <sup>2</sup> is written as one of the below:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    #using the 'raise to power' sign 
                    3&#770; 2 = 9 
                    #using double asterik sign 
                    3**2 = 9
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Lastly, modulo gives the remainder of a number. This is especially useful when we want to know if a number is
                even or odd. An example is shown below where it can be seen that 10 is even number because when it is divided
                by 2, it remains 0:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    #Here the remainder of the the division is zero 
                    10 % 2 = 0
                 
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>numbers can also be put into a variable and used later. For example, below, age_of_father, age_of_mother and
                age_of_child are variables that can be used later</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    age_of_father = 27 age_of_mother = 25 age_of_child = 3
                    age_of_family = age_of_father + age_of_mother + age_of_child 
                    age_of_family = 55
                </code>
             </pre>
        </section>

        <section id="Strings" class="main-section">
            <header>Strings</header>
            <p>Strings are texts. It is used almost the same way we do in real life. In python, strings are surrounded by quotation
                marks(e.g "candy"). Strings can also be assigned to a variable and printed. See below:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    #assign Oyelowo to name_of_friend
                    name_of_friend = "Oyelowo" 
                    
                    #print name_of_friend
                    print(name_of_friend)

                    #this gives the result below: 
                    Oyelowo
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Strings can also be combined. This is called concatenation and it is done with the addition sign.
            </p>
            <p>Example of concatenation</p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    print("Face" + "book")

                    #the above gives the result below:
                    Facebook
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Strings can also be concatenated with numbers by converting the number to strings. This can be done by using
                "str" function. Try example below:
            </p>
            <p>The below convert 66 to string by using enclosing the number in "str" function</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    print("number" + str(66))

                    #result:
                    number66
                </code>
            </pre>
        </section>

        <section id="Lists" class="main-section">
            <header>Lists</header>
            <p>Just as the name implies, Lists are used in python to include list of items. They are usually enclosed in brackets(that
                is: [ ]). Lists can include floats, integer or strings and each of the elements can be selected by indexing
                them from 0. I will explain further below:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    #List of numbers ffive numbers
                    [3, 5, 6, 7, 8]

                    #List of four names names
                    [Sana, Samuel, Mika, Aleksi]
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>To select Mika, we can index the list. indexing starts counting from 0. In our case, Sana would be 0 element,
                Samuel is 1, Mika is 2, Aleksi is 3.
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    list_of_names = [Sana, Samuel, Mika, Aleksi]

                    #to select Mika, we would select by index as below:
                    list_of_names[2]

                    #this gives:
                    Mika
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>You can also try the above on your computer</p>

            <p>You can also select all the names by:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    #This selects all the elements in a list
                    list_of_names[:]

                    #result:
                    Sana, Samuel, Mika, Aleksi

                    #another way of selecting
                    list_of_names[0:2]

                    #result
                    Sana, Samuel, Mika
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>You can also combine two ists</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    [1,2,3,4] + [5,6,7]

                    #result
                    [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>mathematical operations can also be performed on every element.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    list = [2, 4, 3]

                    list**2 

                    #result
                    [4, 16, 9]

            <p>While statement is used here similarly to the way we know in normal English language. For example:

            <pre>
                <code>
                    age = 0
                    while age &lt; 10:
                        print(age)
                        age = age + 1 

                    #the above should print

            </pre>
            <p>
                what happened above is that, the initial age was 0, then we said "while the age is less than 10, print the age". We then,
                increase the age by 1 everytime. The age continues to print until the statement becomes false(i.e when age
                is not less than 10)</p>

            <header>if elif and else Statements</header>
            <p>This is a conditional statement which is also used similarly to our day-to-day conditional actions.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    samuel_age = 20

                    Samuel is older
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>The code above prints the statement because samuel is truly older than lowo. If he is not, the statement prints
                nothing.
            </p>

            <p>We can also have multiple conditions, using if elif and else; and , or. For example</p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    temperature = 15
                    month = "June" 

                    if temperature &lt; 0:
                        print("temperature is freezing")

                    elif temperature &gt; 0 or temperature &lt; 10:
                        print("temperature is cool")

                    elif temperature &gt; 10 and month is "may" or month is "June":
                        print("temperature is warm and it is summer")
                        
                    else: 
                        print("It is fall")

                    #result
                    temperature is warn and it is summer
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>The above prints temperature is warm and it is summer because that is the statement that fulfils the condition.
                Temperature which was defined earlier is 15 and season is June, which follows the third condition, therefore,
                the statement in the block is printed. As you can see from the above, we can also have complex statements
                in python. However, the cool thing is that the syntax is very simple and self explanatory.

            <p> this does not give so much, until you

            <p>Here, the number stops printing at
                <strong>5</strong> because we break the loop. loop is another fancy name for iteration. Continute statement works
                similarly but continues with iteration.</p>

        <section id="pass_Statements" class="main-section">

            <p>The pass statement does not really do anything. It is merely used for syntax purpose when you don't want to do
                anyting but you don't want the program to break your code by complaining about some errors.</p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    while True:
                        pass
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>without the pass statement above, our code will be broken. This is especially useful when writing functions and
                you don't want to break your code. You will get more familiar with this with experience. Don't worry, it
                is very easy to understand.

        <section id="Defining_Functions" class="main-section">
            <header>Defining Functions</header>
            <p>Functions are one of the most important aspect of programming generally. It prevents repetition. When you have
                an operation that you repeat over and over again, it is time to write it as a function. This can easily be
                used later by parsing the parameters.
                <strong>Parsing</strong> again, is another fancy name for input.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    def add(a, b):
                        added_numbers = a + b
                        return added_numbers

                    #To use the function above
                    add(a=7, b=12)

                    #result: 
                    19
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>In the example above,
                <strong>a</strong> and
                <strong>b</strong> are called
                <strong>parameters</strong>. The
                <strong>return</strong> statement at the end is also important to make sure that the result is generated when the
                function is used. The function basically performs a task of adding two numbers togeter. Next time, when we
                need to repeat this task, we can just
                <strong>call</strong> our function parse in the parameters and it will generate the result. </p>

            <p>A lot more complex and interesting tasks can be achieved with this. However, this is the general idea behind
                defining and usin functions.
