                <h1>PYTHON FOR KIDS</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Python is a beautiful language just like all normal human languages. It has a very simple syntax. You must be
                wondering what syntax is? It is just a fancy name for the codes we write. The cool thing about python is
                that it is one of the most used in the world, even by big companies like google. In short, it is simple and
                very powerful!</p>
            <p> A typical python code looks as simple as below:</p>
            <code>
                if 1 &lt; 2: print("1 is less than 2") else: print("1 is not greater than 2")
            </code>
            <p>You see? It is as simple as what you know. It gets more detailed but not too complicated.</p>
            <p>Thigns you can do in python include:</p>

            <li>Data science: Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>Web development</li>
            <li>Automation of tasks</li>
            <li>Software Development</li>
            <p></p>
        </section>

        <section id="part_2" class="main-section">
            <header>Python as a Calculator</header>
            <p>Python is also a calculator and can be used to do simple and extremely complex calculations. This is very useful
                to do our complex task to building the biggest intelligent machines in the world. It can also help in building
                games too.
            </p>
            <ul>Arithmetic Operations include:
                <li>Addition(+)</li>
                <li>Subtraction(-)</li>
                <li>Division(/)</li>
                <li>Multiplication(*)</li>
                <li>Modulo or Remainder(//)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="part_3" class="main-section">
            <header>Numbers</header>
            <p> The python interpreter is just like the calculators we use. You can give it some instructions, and it gives the
                result. It also follows similar operations we use in our normal life.</p>
            In python, we have:
            <li>integer</li>
            <li>float</li>

            <p>Integer are basically whole numbers while float are fractions. You can perform all the above and more mathematical
                operations on these number types. '#' sign is used for commenting.
            </p>

            <p>example of addition operations:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    #integer 
                    2 + 3 = 5 
                    
                    #float 
                    4.4 + 2.5 = 6.9
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Subtraction:</p>
            <code>
                #integer 5-3 = 2 #float 8.6 - 3.4 =5.2 #float and integer 6.5 - 4 = 2.5
            </code>

            <p>Division:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    #integer division 
                    20 / 5 = 4 

                    #float and integer division 
                    5.5/5 = 1.1
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Multiplication:</p>
            <code>
                20 * 5 = 100
            </code>

            <p>Square root: In python. 3
                <sup>2</sup> is written as one of the below:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    #using the 'raise to power' sign 
                    3&#770; 2 = 9 
                    #using double asterik sign 
                    3**2 = 9
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Lastly, modulo gives the remainder of a number. This is especially useful when we want to know if a number is
                even or odd. An example is shown below where it can be seen that 10 is even number because when it is divided
                by 2, it remains 0:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    #Here the remainder of the the division is zero 
                    10 // 2 = 0
                 
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>numbers can also be put into an object and used later. For example, below, age_of_father, age_of_mother and age_of_child
                are objects that can be used later</p>
            <pre>
            <code>
                age_of_father = 27 age_of_mother = 25 age_of_child = 3
                age_of_family = age_of_father + age_of_mother + age_of_child 
                age_of_family = 55
            </code>
             </pre>
        </section>

        <section id="part_4" class="main-section">
            <header>STRINGS</header>
            <p>Strings is a fancy word for alphabets. It is used almost the same way we do in real life. In python, strings
                are surrounded by aprostrphe(e.g "candy"). Strings can also be assigned to an object and printed. See below:
            </p>
            <code>
                #assign Oyelowo to name_of_friend = "Oyelowo" print(name_of_friend)
            </code>
            Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single
            quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result [2]. \ can be used to escape quotes: >>> >>> 'spam
            eggs' # single quotes 'spam eggs' >>> 'doesn\'t' # use \' to escape the single quote... "doesn't" >>> "doesn't"
            # ...or use double quotes instead "doesn't" >>> '"Yes," he said.' '"Yes," he said.' >>> "\"Yes,\" he said." '"Yes,"
            he said.' >>> '"Isn\'t," she said.' '"Isn\'t," she said.' In the interactive interpreter, the output string is
            enclosed in quotes and special characters are escaped with backslashes. While this might sometimes look different
            from the input (the enclosing quotes could change), the two strings are equivalent. The string is enclosed in
            double quotes if the string contains a single quote and no double quotes, otherwise it is enclosed in single
            quotes. The print() function produces a more readable output, by omitting the enclosing quotes and by printing
            escaped and special characters: >>> >>> '"Isn\'t," she said.' '"Isn\'t," she said.' >>> print('"Isn\'t," she
            said.') "Isn't," she said. >>> s = 'First line.\nSecond line.' # \n means newline >>> s # without print(), \n
            is included in the output 'First line.\nSecond line.' >>> print(s) # with print(), \n produces a new line First
            line. Second line. If you don’t want characters prefaced by \ to be interpreted as special characters, you can
            use raw strings by adding an r before the first quote: >>> >>> print('C:\some\name') # here \n means newline!
            C:\some ame >>> print(r'C:\some\name') # note the r before the quote C:\some\name String literals can span multiple
            lines. One way is using triple-quotes: """...""" or '''...'''. End of lines are automatically included in the
            string, but it’s possible to prevent this by adding a \ at the end of the line. The following example: print("""\
            Usage: thingy [OPTIONS] -h Display this usage message -H hostname Hostname to connect to """) produces the following
            output (note that the initial newline is not included): Usage: thingy [OPTIONS] -h Display this usage message
            -H hostname Hostname to connect to Strings can be concatenated (glued together) with the + operator, and repeated
            with *: >>> >>> # 3 times 'un', followed by 'ium' >>> 3 * 'un' + 'ium' 'unununium' Two or more string literals
            (i.e. the ones enclosed between quotes) next to each other are automatically concatenated. >>> >>> 'Py' 'thon'
            'Python' This feature is particularly useful when you want to break long strings: >>> >>> text = ('Put several
            strings within parentheses '
